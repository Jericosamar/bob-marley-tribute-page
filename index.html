            <p>Oh I say
                Preacher man, don't tell me
                Heaven is under the earth
                I know you don't know
                What life is really worth
                It's not all that glitters is gold
                'Alf the story has never been told
                So now you see the light, eh

                <p>Get up, stand up (Lord, Lord) stand up for your rights (What you got to give?)
                Get up, stand up (For the life you live) don't give up the fight (Yeah)
                Get up, stand up (Life is your right) stand up for your rights (Without life you can't fight)
                Get up, stand up (Keep the good time calling) don't give up the fight (Oh Lord)</p>
                <p>Most people think
                Great god will come from the skies
                Take away everything
                And make everybody feel high
                But if you know what life is worth
                You will look for yours on earth
                And now you see the light
                You stand up for your rights jah</p>

                Get up, stand up! (Get up, stand up!)
                Don't give up the fight! (Life is your right!)
                Get up, stand up! (So we can't give up the fight!)
                Stand up for your rights! (Lord, lord!)
                Get up, stand up! (Keep on struggling on!)
                Don't give up the fight! (Yeah!)</p>

                Dyin' 'n' goin' to heaven in-a Jesus' name, lord
                We know when we understand
                Almighty god is a living man
                You can fool some people sometimes
                But you can't fool all the people all the time
                So now we see the light (What you gonna do?)
                We gonna stand up for our rights! (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)</p>
                <p>So you better
                Get up, stand up! (In the morning! git it up!)
                Stand up for your rights! (Stand up for our rights!)
